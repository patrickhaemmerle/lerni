# Lerni
Lerni is my personal fun project to learn Ruby on Rails and to learn about how to use Github effectively for project management. I started lerni with the intention to create a web based card learning app. While ther may be no need for another app or service for this it serves me perfectly for my needs. To learn about the features that should be implemented, then follow the Link to the current development milestone. To learn about my expiriences with Ruby on Rails and Github, then read on in this document.
