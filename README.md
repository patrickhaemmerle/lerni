# Lerni
Lerni is my personal fun project to learn Ruby on Rails and to learn about how to use Github effectively for project management. I started lerni with the intention to create a web based card learning app. While ther may be no need for another app or service for this it serves me perfectly for my needs. To learn about the features that should be implemented, then follow the Link to the current development milestone. To learn about my expiriences with Ruby on Rails and Github, then read on in this document.

Current Development Milestone: https://github.com/patrickhaemmerle/lerni/milestone/1

# My experience with Ruby on Rails 

The first time I heard of Rails an tried it out it was the _convention over configuration_ thing that convinced me. Some things turned out to be not so easy as it seemed. For example I very quickly came to the conclusion that the default scaffolding seems to be too simple. And there are a lot of situations where scaffolding is simply not what I want.I ended up generating the model, then generating an empty controller and start from here. Most of the repetitive tasks are done by the generators and I can start with the fun part.
